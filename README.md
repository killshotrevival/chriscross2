This is a game I used to play in my school days, except that time we use to play it with pen and paper, but this time we have it on a computer game basis. In this game, two players are provided with a certain no. of players, which they can move around on the screen. As a player's move crosses the opponent's earlier move, the user is awarded a point.
The game also has a surprise element of 'Randomness', which effects the game largely.
